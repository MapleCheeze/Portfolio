## The Intersection of People, Tech, & Privacy

I am a cybersecurity professional who believes that true security isn’t just about firewalls—it’s about empowering people. In an era of data sprawl, I am a vocal advocate for **Privacy Engineering**. I believe security should be the silent pulse that enables a business to run safely, protecting the individual's right to privacy while ensuring the enterprise's right to operate.

## From Enterprise Scale to Organization Impact
My experience is built on leading security for global enterprise environments, but my passion lies in bringing that same level of resilience to organizations of all sizes. I specialize in bridging the gap between "bits and bytes" and "business risk." 

Whether I am working with resource-constrained NGOs at the **CyberPeace Institute** or managing complex architectures at **JR Automation**, my goal is the same: to move the needle from reactive firefighting to proactive, strategic defense.

## Validated Expertise
*While hands-on results are my priority, I maintain a rigorous standard of professional certification to ensure my strategies align with global industry standards:*

* **CISSP** – Certified Information Systems Security Professional
* **CISM** – Certified Information Security Manager
* **Microsoft Cybersecurity Architect Expert (SC-100)**
* **Microsoft Security Operations Analyst (SC-200)**
* **Microsoft Azure Security Engineer (AZ-500)**

## Freelance & Strategic Advisory
I partner with organizations to find their unique security "rhythm." I don't just "install tools"—I build programs that enable business growth. My freelance services include:

* **Cloud Security Architecture:** Designing secure landing zones and managing **Azure Policies** to enforce governance and compliance automatically.
* **Defender for Cloud & XDR:** Moving beyond basic antivirus to full-stack protection across Endpoint, Identity, and Cloud workloads.
* **Security Operations (SecOps):** Optimizing **Microsoft Sentinel** and automating alert triage using **Python and Logic Apps** to give your team their time back.
* **Email & Identity Defense:** Implementing advanced email threat protection and **Zero Trust** identity models to stop the #1 vector of attack.
* **Security Culture:** Strengthening the "Human Firewall" through tailored training and meaningful phishing simulations that people actually learn from.
