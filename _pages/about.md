## The Intersection of People, Tech, & Privacy

I am a cybersecurity professional who believes that true security isn’t just about secuirty tools, but instead it’s about empowering people. In an era of data sprawl, I am a vocal advocate for **Privacy Engineering**. I believe security should be the silent pulse that enables a business to run safely, protecting the individual's right to privacy while ensuring the enterprise's right to operate.

## From Enterprise Scale to Organization Impact
My experience is built on leading security for global enterprise environments, but my passion lies in bringing that same level of resilience to organizations of all sizes. I specialize in bridging the gap between "bits and bytes" and "business risk." 

Whether I am working with resource-constrained NGOs at the CyberPeace Institute or managing complex architectures at enterprises, my goal is the same: to move the needle from reactive firefighting to proactive, strategic defense.

## Validated Expertise
*While hands-on results are my priority, I maintain a rigorous standard of professional certification to ensure my strategies align with global industry standards:*

* **CISSP** – Certified Information Systems Security Professional
* **CISM** – Certified Information Security Manager
* **Microsoft Cybersecurity Architect Expert (SC-100)**
* **Microsoft Security Operations Analyst (SC-200)**
* **Microsoft Azure Security Engineer (AZ-500)**

## Freelance & Strategic Advisory
I partner with organizations to find their unique security "rhythm." My freelance services include:

* **Cloud Security Architecture:** Designing secure landing zones and managing **Azure Policies** to enforce governance and compliance automatically.
* **Defender for Cloud & XDR:** Moving beyond basic antivirus to full-stack protection across Endpoint, Identity, and Cloud workloads.
* **Security Operations (SecOps):** Optimizing **SIEM Solutions** and automating response workflows 
* **Email & Identity Defense:** Implementing advanced email threat protection and **Zero Trust** identity models to stop the #1 vector of attack.
* **Security Culture:** Cultivating an environment where data protection is second nature. I help teams move past "Human Firewall" jargon toward a culture of shared responsibility, utilizing simulations that empower employees to be the first line of defense for both security and privacy.
